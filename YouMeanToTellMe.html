            <br>
            I used to think that<br>
            I would never fall in love<br>
            And then you showed me<br>
            That you could be anything I want<br>
            I gave my heart away<br>
            They put it on a shelf<br>
            and then you came around<br>
            Picked me up off the floor<br>
            You put me back together<br>
            I couldn't believe it<br>
            Let me get this straight<br>
            You don't want to date<br>
            You just wanna be someone I can always to turn<br>
            Right until the end<br>
            Can you say that again?<br>
            I'm sorry, I just wanna make sure that I heard you<br>
            I waited for you my whole life<br>
            You don't know what you mean to me<br>
            If you asked me to be your wife<br>
            I would turn around and say<br>
            You mean to tell me that<br>
            I could have you whenever I want<br>
            I could tell you that I love you when you love too<br>
            No more waiting forever our love<br>
            But I would wait all over again<br>
            If it means I get you<br>
            I never been more sure of the unknow<br>
            Just wanna show you how far my love goes<br>
            You mean to tell me that you feel the same?<br>
            Then,baby, I'm here to stay<br>
            I can't believe that I found the one<br>
            Yeah, my search is done now<br>
            When you said to me<br>
            Will you be my wife for the rest of my life<br>
            For better or worse<br>
            Baby, no, these aren't just words to me<br>
            So take me to church<br>
            We'll be forever and ever<br>
            Every woman deserves a king<br>
            You mean the world to me<br>
            We could be everything<br>
            Together just us<br>
            I waited for you my whole life<br>
            You don't know what you mean to me<br>
            If you asked me to be your wife<br>
            I would turn around and say<br>
            You mean to tell me that<br>
            I could have you whenever I want<br>
            I could tell you that I love you when you love too<br>
            No more waiting forever our love<br>
            But I would wait all over again<br>
            If it means I get you<br>
            I never been more sure of the unknow<br>
            Just wanna show you how far my love goes<br>
            You mean to tell me that you feel the same?<br>
            Then,baby, I'm here to stay<br>
            Anywhere in the world<br>
            I would go with you  (I would go with you, babe)<br>
            We could be anywhere in the world<br>
            As long as I'm with you  (As long as I'm with you, babe)<br>
            And I can't wait <br><br><br>
