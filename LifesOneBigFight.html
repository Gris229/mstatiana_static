            <br>
            Letting go of everything<br>
            That has ever had a hold on me<br>
            No more running when I'm scared<br>
            Running never gets you anywhere<br>
            <br>
            I used to care but now it's whatever<br>
            They don't want you to do better<br>
            They'll get you down if you let them<br>
            Just remember no pain is forever<br>
            I know it's hard to forget how wrong they did you<br>
            All of the shit that you've through<br>
            All of fights you got it<br>
            Just remember that God is still with you<br>
            <br>
            They wanna bring you down, bring you down ohho<br>
            They can't bring you down, bring you down ohhooo<br>
            Life is one big fight,<br>
            Everyday and every night<br>
            We gonn' be alright<br>
            Yeah we gonn' be alright<br>
            Life is one big fight<br>
            <br>
            Give or take<br>
            Everyone is out there for themselves<br>
            Give or take<br>
            A couple broken hearts as long as they get everything they needed from you<br>
            But you can never let them feel like they're above you, above you<br>
            Life can be cruel<br>
            Life can be hard<br>
            You gottta keep fighting<br>
            Don't let down your guts<br>
            The battles you've been through make you who you are<br>
            I had to learn how to be bright on my skies<br>
            <br>
            'Cause life can be so hard, so hard<br>
            And I know you just feel like<br>
            Letting go everything is way too heavy<br>
            Nobody is ever ready to be ready<br>
            And I know you just feel like<br>
            Letting go everything is way too heavy<br>
            Nobody is ever ready to be ready<br>
            And I know you've been stressing<br>
            It's okay 'cause you're best things under way<br>
            Don't you worry about what they say, what they say<br>
            <br>
            They can't bring you down, bring you down ohhooo<br>
            Life is one big fight,<br>
            Everyday and every night<br>
            We gonn' be alright<br>
            Yeah we gonn' be alright<br>
            <br><br>
