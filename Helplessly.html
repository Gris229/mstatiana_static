            It's not that easy with you here<br>
            But I know I want you to stay<br>
            See this could be us in a few years<br>
            But just admit you would like to play<br>
            It's like everyday am kicking rocks<br>
            I could fly away but you got me <br>
            At the complete stop how do you<br>
            Manage keep me going<br>
            But somehow you keep me from going<br>
            <br>
            See you distract me <br>
            But am distracted without you<br>
            I don't know how to focus baby teach me how to<br>
            'Cause am standing still again<br>
            But if you love me<br>
            Just like the way that I love you<br>
            I wouldn't mind a little comforting from you<br>
            Why do I let you in my head <br>
            <br>
            And I gotta go sometimes but you're always on my mind<br>
            You're not helping me<br>
            You're not helping me<br>
            You're not helping mee<br>
            You're not helping me<br>
            You're not helping me<br>
            But I helplessly fall for you <br>
            <br>
            Now am running late<br>
            And am not a coffee drinker<br>
            But I lost sleep just thinking of you<br>
            So pour me a cup<br>
            I need to wake up<br>
            I need me some <br>
            Now give it to me <br>
            'Cause everywhere you go I'll follow you<br>
            I'll give you all of me <br>
            Give me all of you <br>
            I gotta go sometimes but you're always on my mind <br>
            <br>
            See you distract me <br>
            But am distracted without you<br>
            I don't know how to focus baby teach me how to<br>
            'Cause am standing still again<br>
            'Cause if you love me<br>
            Just like the way that I love you<br>
            I wouldn't mind a little comforting from you<br>
            Why do I let you in my head ?<br>
            Ouuhouuh<br>
            <br>
            And I gotta go sometimes but you're always on my mind<br>
            You're not helping me babe<br>
            You're not helping me babe<br>
            But I fall helplessly for you, for you<br>

            You're not helping me babe<br>
            But I fall helplessly for you<br>
