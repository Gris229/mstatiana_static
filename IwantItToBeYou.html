            <br>
            Not anyone but you<br>
            Not anyone but you, babe<br>
            Could you be more than lonely?<br>
            Hey! I want you<br>
            <br>
            What if I told you that I really like you<br>
            What if I showed you that maybe I can surprise you<br>
            Would you be so kind to open up your mind and heart to me?<br>
            Would it be alright if we just ride along this road and see<br>
            That I can be anyone but you, not anyone but you<br>
            Because I want it to be you<br>
            I want it to be you<br>
            I want you !<br>
            <br>
            I said hey, let's take a ride down the interstate 5<br>
            Even squeeze in a diner for two<br>
            Just in that moment yes everything told me <br>
            That I want you to be the one who cheers me up<br>
            And gives me hugs when I am feeling low (we)<br>
            And tell me everything will be alright<br>
            and when I cry I know that I don't look the same<br>
            But can you tell me that I'm pretty anyway?<br>
            Could you be my one and only?<br>
            Could you be the one to<br>
            Hold me close<br>
            In the daytime and the night time, what do you say?<br>
            We can go, to a place that I know you like-like<br>
            What would you say, if I give my heart to you?<br>
            Will you be my lover?<br>
            'Cause I want this night for you <br>
            No I don't want no other<br>
            <br>
            I just want it to be you, is that a problem?<br>
            We know we go together like cranberry and vodka<br>
            And when I see you walking, you don't need a red carpet<br>
            'Cause you a star in my eyes, and girl, I'm starstruck<br>
            Baby, how you summertime fine year-round?<br>
            And everything is better whenever that you are around <br>
            There's a lot of fish in the sea but I ain't fishing<br>
            Baby tryna throw shade but I don't listen I'm like, damn girl<br>
            How you come up in this thing without your man, girl?<br>
            I've been watching what you doing, I'm a fan girl<br>
            I just tryna get away, what's your plan girl?<br>
            Give me your hand girl<br>
            <br>
            I want it to be you<br>
            I want it to be you<br>
            <br><br>
