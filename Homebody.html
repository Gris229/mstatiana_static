            Always been the one that's so misunderstood<br>
            But somehow you still get me out of nowhere<br>
            My heart wants to go places I don't know about<br>
            But there's something that my mind just won't allow oh, yeah<br>
            <br>
            See I be caring, true<br>
            Way too okay staying, yeah<br>
            I never breakthrough<br>
            Been feeling the same for years<br>
            I didn't want tou to feel like I need you here <br>
            But baby it's true<br>
            Love know when you're coming through<br>
            <br>
            And you I don't trust<br>
            Some of my own thoughts<br>
            But I've connecting<br>
            Some of my own dots<br>
            <br>
            And baby the truth is<br>
            To me it's useless<br>
            If I don't share the world with somebody exclusive, yeah yeah<br>
            <br>
            I know I never had no cares <br>
            To see about the world out there<br>
            But baby, can we go somewhere?<br>
            <br>
            'Cause I'm a homebody yeah you know that<br>
            I've been in these walls for my whole life<br>
            But whenever I'm with youBabe you make me wanna see the world<br>
            Oh yeah oh yeah<br>
            <br>
            Places that you know, we can go there<br>
            We can go whenever, babe, I don't care<br>
            As long as I'm with you, we can go anywhere in the world<br>
            Baby, I would go with you<br>
            Baby, I would go with you<br>
            <br>
            Have you ever felt like you're too far away<br>
            Way too out of touch so you don't have much to say<br>
            Try to hold the world, so you took off far away<br>
            Baby, do it all, I'm just hoping that you stay <br>
            'Long as I got, baby, I am not afraid <br>
            As long I got you, baby, I am not afraid<br>
            <br><br>
