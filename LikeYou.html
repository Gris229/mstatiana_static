            You got to get up<br>
            You got to get up and make a move<br>
            'Cause the world will never see you until you do<br>
            No, they don't really care what you're going through<br>
            So you got to show them, baby<br>
            You got to show them the real you<br>
            You got to give them what you've got<br>
            No, don't let them say what you're not<br>
            'Cause you are strong, you are wise<br>
            You are worth beyond the thousand reasons why<br>
            And you can't be perfect, baby<br>
            'Cause nobody's perfect, darling<br>
            But, no no no there's nobody in the world like you<br>

            What do you do when you can't let go?<br>
            What do you say when you just don't know how you feel?<br>
            And you know nobody knows how you feel<br>
            'Cause everybody got their own damn problem<br>
            So everybody's trying to find their way<br>
            And day by day is the struggle<br>
            In this world you know you have to hustle<br>
            Just know that you're not alone<br>
            You don't always have to be strong all by yourself<br>
            I said, it's okay to ask for help<br>
            Now listen, people will find you, but they don't define you<br>
            And you will find people who'll help redesign you<br>
            People will find you, but they don't define you<br>
            And you will find people who'll help redesign you<br>
            You are a work of art<br>
            Bet you didn't you'd come this far<br>
            Now here you are<br>
            Baby you are strong, you are wise<br>
            You are worth beyond the thousand reasons why<br>
            And you can't be perfect, baby<br>
            'Cause nobody's perfect, darling<br>
            But, no no no there's nobody in the world like you<br>
            You know you're worth it, 'cause you know that you can't be perfect, darling<br>
            I love you just the way that you are<br>
            I love you just the way that you are, my love<br>
            It's like the stars in the sky, oh, when you look in my eyes<br>
            <br><br><br>
